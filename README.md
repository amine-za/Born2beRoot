My tasks included:

Hardening the server by setting up a firewall (UFW), strict password policies, and a secure sudo configuration.

Moving the SSH service to a non-standard port and disabling root login.

Partitioning the disk and setting up LVM (Logical Volume Management) with encryption.

Writing a Bash script (monitoring.sh) to monitor system health.
